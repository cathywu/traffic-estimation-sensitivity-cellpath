A random path from is shown in red with the closest cell towers.}}

We consider a medium sized network and the following scenarios
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{???} ($N=375$):
\item \textbf{City Center} ($N=375$): We emulate a popular commercial district with a dense sampling of cellular towers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}

“sparser”: smallest number of cell towers for which route flow accuracy is pretty good ($<5\%$ error); hopefully somewhat robust to handoff model

“city center”: super dense number of cell towers; handoff model should cause tons of problems here quickly
