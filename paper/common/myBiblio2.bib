  Abstract                 = {In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), transportation infrastructure is complimented with information and communication technologies with the objectives of attaining improved passenger safety, reduced transportation time and fuel consumption and vehicle wear and tear. With the advent of modern communication and computational devices and inexpensive sensors it is possible to collect and process data from a number of sources. Data fusion (DF) is collection of techniques by which information from multiple sources are combined in order to reach a better inference. \{DF\} is an inevitable tool for ITS. This paper provides a survey of how \{DF\} is used in different areas of ITS. },
